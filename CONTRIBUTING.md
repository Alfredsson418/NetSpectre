<h1>Coding format</h1>
<p>This project is using ClangFormat to automaticlly format the source code defined in the .clang_format file.</p>

<h2>Automatic formating with ...</h2>

<h3>Zed</h3>
<p>Add this to your settings</p>

```
  "languages": {
    "C": {
      "format_on_save": "on"
    }
  },
  "file_types": {
    "C": ["c", "h"]
  }
```

<p>This configuration will automaticlly update the format on save for C, this will also determine that files ending with .c/.h will be using the C languange, with Zed sometimes gets confused with C++.</p>
